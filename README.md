# Counting_Contours
Counting the rices(contour) in the image.

Project basicly dealing with contours from OpenCV lib. Firstly finds the contours with findcontours() method and then draws and counts that contours. And finally plots 
all the operations and the count of the contours(rices).

You can look into the code and the comment lines for further detail.
